      <p>     The robbery
        It was during a robbery in New York City that the thief shouted, addressing the employees inside the bank:
        Do not move, money belongs to the state, and your life belongs to you.
        So everyone lay on the floor calmly ..
        This is called the concept of changing thinking.
        When the thieves finished stealing, the younger thief, who holds a college degree for the thief leader, was the oldest of them and he is a primary school graduate:
        O leader, let's count how much money we took.
        The leader made his river and told him: Are you stupid ?! This is a large amount of money and it takes us a long time to count, tonight we will know from the news bulletins how much money we stole !!
        "This is called expertise."
        in these days, experience is more important than paper qualifications
        After the thieves left the bank, the bank manager told the branch manager: Call the police quickly, but the branch manager said to him: Wait, let's take 10 million dollars and keep them for ourselves and add them to the 70 million dollars that we stole before !!
        "This is called swimming with the current and transforming the situation to your advantage."
        The bank manager said: So it would be great if there was a robbery every month ...
        "This is called persistence."
        The next day, news agencies reported that $ 100 million was stolen from the bank !!
        The thieves got up after the money over and over again, and every time they found that the amount was only $ 20 million, the thieves got very angry and said we risked our lives for $ 20 million and the bank manager got $ 80 million without getting dirty. It seems like it is better to Being educated rather than being a thief
        "This is called knowledge equal to gold."
        The bank manager was smiling happy because he had become a millionaire and all his losses on the stock market were covered by this theft.
        "This is called seizing opportunity."
        The real thieves are often the ones with the highest positions, but they are thieves with testimonies

        <p> Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages.
        They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common applications of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging, and signage.</p>
