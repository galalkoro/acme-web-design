      <p>     The robbery
        It was during a robbery in New York City that the thief shouted, addressing the employees inside the bank:
        Do not move, money belongs to the state, and your life belongs to you.
        So everyone lay on the floor calmly ..
        This is called the concept of changing thinking.
        When the thieves finished stealing, the younger thief, who holds a college degree for the thief leader, was the oldest of them and he is a primary school graduate:
        O leader, let's count how much money we took.
        The leader made his river and told him: Are you stupid ?! This is a large amount of money and it takes us a long time to count, tonight we will know from the news bulletins how much money we stole !!
        "This is called expertise."

        <p> Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages.
        They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common applications of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging, and signage.</p>
